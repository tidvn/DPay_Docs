Always keep your secrets secret! `Token` is a secret, so make sure you don't commit it to a public repository or include it in your code. When possible, use environment variables and avoid exposing `Token`. Ideally, setup your own application backend to securely store your `Token` to prevent the leakage. Otherwise, someone else could piggyback on your token.
