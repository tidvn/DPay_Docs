In order to use Dpay API, you need to create an account first.

## Log in / Sign up

When [creating a DPay account](/auth/signin) you can use your extension wallet through Eternl and Nami. With an account, you can start building your apps!

## Generate your mechant secret token

*If you lose it , there is no way to recover , please generate new*
<Callout>
Always keep your secrets secret! `Token` is a secret, so make sure you don't commit it to a public repository or include it in your code. When possible, use environment variables and avoid exposing `Token`. Ideally, setup your own application backend to securely store your `Token` to prevent the leakage. Otherwise, someone else could piggyback on your token.
